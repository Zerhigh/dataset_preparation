# Repository: dataset_preparation

This repository is part of the master’s thesis: [Evaluating_Sentinel-2_Super-Resolution_Algorithms_for_Automated_Building_Delineation](https://github.com/Zerhigh/Evaluating_Sentinel-2_Super-Resolution_Algorithms_for_Automated_Building_Delineation)


This project contains scripts and utilities for preparing datasets used in evaluating super-resolution algorithms on Sentinel-2 imagery, for the purpose of automated building delineation.

The repository includes:

- `experiment_stratification.py` — logic for splitting/stratifying data for experiments  
- `inferred_image_sampling.py` — sampling inferred images and conversion to display in publications   
- `evaluation_full_per_model.py` — evaluation routines to assess test-dataset model performances from metrics extracted from wandb
